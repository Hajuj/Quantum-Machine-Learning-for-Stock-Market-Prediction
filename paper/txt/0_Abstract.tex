The stock market serves as a dynamic arena for financial transactions, wherein investors strategically trade stocks, aiming to capitalize on price fluctuations for profit. Given the computational complexity and cost associated with predicting stock price movements, this paper undertakes a comparative analysis between classical and quantum machine learning methodologies to forecast financial data efficiently. Specifically, we investigate quantum Long-Short-Term-Memory models, optimizing them to discern the impact of various parameters on prediction quality.
Our models are trained to forecast stock behavior for both one and ten days ahead. Remarkably, while the quantum approach demonstrates comparable performance to classical methods for one-day predictions, it excels in the ten-day forecast domain. These findings suggest the potential of quantum computing to enhance financial time series forecasting. However, it is imperative to note that the current limitations of quantum hardware remain prominent.
